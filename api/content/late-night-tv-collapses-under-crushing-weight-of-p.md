In a shocking turn of events, the late-night TV format has finally imploded under the crushing weight of its own self-importance. It's a wonder it lasted this long, considering the likes of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert spent years shouting at empty chairs and winking at the camera like a pair of middle-aged frat boys.

But seriously, have you seen the ratings for late-night TV lately? They're in freefall, because who needs quality comedy or informative journalism when you can get it from Twitter? And don't even get me started on the "comedians" who think that reading tweets from 2009 out loud is a form of satire. (Cough, John Oliver, cough.)

As the industry continues to hemorrhage talent and viewers, it's clear that late-night TV has become a relic of a bygone era – one where people actually watched TV for more than just cat videos and clickbait headlines. But don't worry, folks, there are plenty of alternatives now: streaming services, podcasts, and your aunt's Facebook posts about the "real news" she read on some obscure blog.

So long, late-night TV. May your legacy live on in the hearts of those who still think it's 2008 and that The Daily Show is a trusted source of news.
