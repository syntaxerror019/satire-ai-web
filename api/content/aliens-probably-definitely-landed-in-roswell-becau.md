Demi Moore, a woman from New Mexico who has somehow managed to parlay her name into a career despite being completely unremarkable, sat down on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert last night and dropped some knowledge about the alleged aliens that landed in Roswell back in 1947. When asked by Colbert what she thought happened, Moore replied with absolute certainty, "Something definitely happened." Wow, okay.

Apparently, Moore's children think she's part alien because of her birthplace, which is a pretty weak excuse for not having any actual evidence to support the existence of extraterrestrial life. But hey, it's something. When Colbert asked if she meant that maybe some aliens did indeed land in Roswell, Moore just shrugged and said "I don't know." Which is totally different from saying "something definitely happened" and making everyone think she actually knows what's going on.

To clarify things for Colbert (and us), Moore explained that the large landing strip in Roswell must be there for a reason... maybe. It's possible that it's not just for testing planes or something boring like that, but who knows? Maybe it's a secret alien runway and they're just waiting for the perfect moment to invade Earth. Stranger things have happened, right?

In related news, Moore is starring in an upcoming film about aliens called Strange Arrivals, because of course she is. It's based on the totally-not-made-up story of Betty and Barney Hill's alleged alien abduction, which was later debunked as a hoax. But hey, why let facts get in the way of a good story?

Colbert seemed to be taking Moore's claims very seriously, but not before joking that maybe the military is behind some kind of top-secret alien project. To which Moore replied with her trademark nonchalance, "It's possible." Because when you're a celebrity, it's totally okay to just make stuff up and hope nobody calls you on it.

In conclusion, Demi Moore thinks aliens definitely landed in Roswell back in the day, but she won't say what exactly happened or why. But hey, who needs facts or evidence when you've got Hollywood cred?
