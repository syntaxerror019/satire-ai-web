As tensions simmer and economies teeter, the world's most powerful (and slightly anxious) policymakers are convening in Washington D.C. for the IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings. Because what could possibly go wrong with putting a bunch of grown adults in suits together in a conference room, am I right? It's not like they'll get distracted by the free donuts or anything.

This year's theme is "Emerging Trends in Global Markets and Capital Flows" – code for "We Have No Idea What We're Doing, But Let's Pretend We Do." Expect heated debates about which type of artisanal coffee to serve at the meetings (it's a real concern, trust me). Meanwhile, outside the conference center, protesters will be holding signs that say things like "IMF: Where Dreams Go To Die" and "World Bank: Because We Can't Trust Our Family With Money Either."

But seriously, folks, this is where the big cheeses get together to decide the fate of the global economy. It's a little like a bad episode of The Hunger Games, minus the thrill and excitement (and also, you know, actual fighting). Join us in watching the world's most powerful people squirm in their seats as they try to keep up with the latest trends in global finance.
