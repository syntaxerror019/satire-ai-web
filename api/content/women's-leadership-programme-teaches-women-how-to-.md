In a bold move, the esteemed Cambridge Judge Business School and the Financial Times have joined forces to create a program specifically designed for women who want to become slightly less awful at leadership. Because, let's be real, traditional leadership programs just aren't cutting it - they're basically just a bunch of old men in suits yelling at each other.

This 4-and-a-half-day extravaganza is tailored to the unique needs of women who are already crushing it (but still need help being less bossy). The program promises to equip participants with the skills and confidence needed to lead without, you know, completely losing their minds. It's like a spa day for your ego.

During this whirlwind experience, participants will learn how to "lead strategically," which is code for "not yelling at people all the time." They'll also get to explore how to "influence across boundaries" - aka how to make their ideas sound less ridiculous when explaining them to someone who disagrees. And, of course, they'll receive a fancy digital certificate and a 12-month subscription to FT.com, because what's a leadership program without a few free perks?

But wait, there's more! Participants will also get access to the Wo+Men's Leadership Centre, where they can network with other women who are just as clueless as they are. It's like a support group for people who want to be in charge but don't know how not to suck at it.

In short, this program is the ultimate solution to all your leadership problems - or at least that's what we're told.
