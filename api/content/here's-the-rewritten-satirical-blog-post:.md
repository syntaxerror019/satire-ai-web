**America is Great Again...and Also on Fire, Literally and Figuratively**

In 2025, America was a country in perfect harmony with itself. Sure, there were some minor issues like climate change, economic inequality, and a president who still didn't understand how social media works, but hey, it's all good! 

Let's start with the good news: Edith Langford, PhD, survived being shot at age 9 and now she's a therapist and adjunct professor. She's living proof that if you get shot, just get right back on that horse (or walker, in her case) and keep going!

Meanwhile, Mahmoud Khalil is still shaking his fist at the world for trying to silence him with ICE detention. Good job, America, for not letting a little thing like deportation stop this Palestinian organiser from keeping it real!

And then there's Mike Thomas, who's part of that totally-not-at-all-creepy "trad" movement where everyone wears plaid and says things like "back in my day..." Yeah, no one's judging you, Mike.

But wait, what's this? A Republican lawmaker named John Davis is all about clean energy...on his own ranch! Who knew conservatives could be so...green?

Oh, and let's not forget LaToya Ratlief, who was shot with a rubber bullet (because we all know that's totally safe) during a 2020 protest. Five years later, she's still dealing with PTSD...but hey, at least she got her settlement.

And then there are the horses grazing outside a massive datacenter in Nevada. Because what's more American than horses and tech giants working together to fuel the AI apocalypse?

But amidst all this chaos, there were also some truly inspiring stories of resilience and determination. Like Edith Langford, PhD (mentioned earlier), who proved that even getting shot can't hold you back from achieving your goals.

And let's not forget about the Trump supporters donning ponchos outside the Trump victory rally at the Capital One Arena in Washington DC! Because nothing says "victory" like a nice, warm poncho on a cold day.

All in all, 2025 was a great year for America. We may have been on fire (literally and figuratively), but we were definitely not burning out...
