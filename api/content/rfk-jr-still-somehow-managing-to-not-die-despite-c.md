In an interview with The Atlantic, RFK Jr, the Secretary of Health and Human Services who is literally the opposite of a health expert, was asked about his questionable life choices. And by "questionable life choices", I mean the fact that he's still alive.

It turns out that RFK Jr has a nicotine habit so strong, it's like he's trying to single-handedly revive the tobacco industry. He's always popping Zyn pouches like they're breath mints - which, you know, they are basically. And when asked about his frequent use of tanning beds, which is just asking for a pre-mature death sentence, he just shrugged it off.

"I'm not telling people to do what I do," he said with a straight face, "I'm just saying 'Get in shape'." Which is like me saying "I'm not warning you about the giant spider on your shoulder, I'm just pointing out that it's there".

Meanwhile, the FDA is over here being all like "Uh, no, RFK Jr, these things are actually super bad for you". But hey, who needs facts and science when you've got a Secretary of Health who's clearly allergic to living healthily?

And don't even get me started on his vaccine-autism conspiracy theories. I mean, it's not like he's spreading misinformation about one of the most thoroughly debunked pseudoscience claims ever. Nope, that's just RFK Jr being his usual level-headed self.

Anyway, let this be a warning to you all: if RFK Jr is still alive despite his many questionable life choices, then what's stopping you from making some poor decisions too? Just saying.
