If you're stuck buying a gift for that one person in the office who somehow still thinks it's okay to eat Cheetos at their desk, then congratulations! You've made my life easier by having to research this topic.

First of all, let's get one thing straight: shower steamers are not the answer. We know they're popular and all, but come on – your coworker who eats Cheetos for breakfast needs something with a little more... umph. That's why I've compiled this list of the best Secret Santa gifts for the desk-dwelling Cheeto aficionado.

For under $35 (because let's be real, you don't want to break the bank on someone who probably eats all their meals in the break room), here are some gift ideas that'll make your coworker question their life choices:

1. A portable air purifier to combat the Cheetos-filled air they breathe every day.
2. A scented candle with a calming aroma, like "freshly cleaned dumpster" or "just-vacuumed office carpet".
3. A set of nice notecards for them to write apologetic notes to their coworkers about the lingering cheese dust on the keyboard.
4. A gift card to a nearby salad bar, because let's be real, they need some greens in their life.

But wait – there's more! If you're feeling extra generous (or just really don't want to deal with them anymore), consider gifting them an air freshener that doubles as a time capsule of regret. Just think about it: every time they spray that Cheeto-scented bomb, they'll be reminded of the poor life choices they've made.

Happy gifting!
