Grief is a powerful thing, mainly because it makes people write angsty video games that we're forced to play so we can pretend we understand what they're going through. But in the case of "Clair Obscure: Expedition 33", maybe the devs actually did feel some feelings and put them into the game instead of just phoning it in like they usually do.

The game's story is basically a French person's existential crisis, but with more explosions and less berets. You play as Gustave, who's on a quest to kill The Paintress, a giant woman who's been painting numbers on a pillar every year, causing his friends and family to die in a blaze of ash and leaves. Because, you know, that's what happens when you're 33 years old - you just spontaneously combust.

The game's art style is a weird mashup of Art Nouveau and Art Deco, which is like someone took all the leftover decorations from a 1920s Parisian nightclub and threw them into a blender. But hey, it works? The music is also kinda cool, I guess, with its medieval lyrics that no one can decipher even if they speak French.

The gameplay is your standard JRPG fare, but with some rhythm game elements because apparently, the devs wanted to make sure we're all exhausted by the time we finish playing. But hey, it's fun in a "I'm-trying-to-understand-this-but-my-brain-is-melting" kind of way.

Overall, "Clair Obscure: Expedition 33" is a game that will make you cry, scream, and question the meaning of life - all at once. But hey, at least it's not just another Soulsborne game with a fancy new coat of paint. So if you're looking for a holiday gift that will drive your loved ones to the brink of madness, this is the perfect choice!
