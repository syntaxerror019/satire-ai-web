In a bold new move, CNN has decided to replace its news anchors with people who have experienced tragedy in their lives, because what could possibly go wrong? Anderson Cooper's podcast, "All There Is," has become a weekly therapy session where he invites celebrities and random acquaintances to share their most heart-wrenching stories of loss and grief.

This week, Cooper spoke with Elaine Pagels, a woman who lost both her husband and 6-year-old son, because clearly that's not enough tragedy for one person. He also had a chat with Alex Van Halen about his brother Eddie, because nothing says "productivity" like discussing the death of a family member on a podcast.

But it gets better! Tyler Perry shared how he avoided dealing with his grief by pouring himself into work (because clearly, that's not just a coping mechanism for most people). And Will Reeve, son of Christopher Reeve, talked about his "long journey into grief," which is actually just code for "I'm still trying to get over my parents' deaths 20 years ago."

We're starting to think that CNN is secretly training its employees in the art of existential dread. If you need a good cry, tune in to this podcast and sob along with Anderson Cooper as he wallows in the misery of others.
