In a bizarre case of déjà vu, leaders within the Anglican Church of North America (ACNA) have once again managed to confuse cause and effect. When abuse survivors come forward with their allegations, they are now apparently considered the problem, not the people who have been abusing them.

Bishop Stewart Ruch, facing allegations that he mishandled multiple cases of abuse in his diocese, sent a letter to then-Archbishop Foley Beach explaining that the "vicious spiritual attack" was actually caused by the survivors themselves. This is reportedly because Satan hates the ACNA for being really good at doing Gospel work. Because, you know, the devil loves it when churches are actually spreading the word of God and not getting caught up in a little thing like abuse.

Meanwhile, current Archbishop Steve Wood is facing allegations of his own, including sexual harassment, bullying, and plagiarism (because who needs original ideas when you can just steal them from someone else?). But hey, at least he's got some solid excuses lined up for when the survivors come after him.
