In a shocking turn of events, Julez Smith revealed that his entire childhood was just one big fashion photoshoot, with his grandma acting as both personal stylist and primary caregiver. "I mean, she deep-washed my hair when it was about that time," he said nonchalantly, while simultaneously twirling an imaginary pom-pom.

It's no wonder that Smith is now a prominent figure in the fashion world, considering he's been getting free wardrobe updates from his grandma since birth. "My family has just been fly my whole life," he explained, as if this were some kind of innate trait rather than a product of his grandma's tireless efforts.

But it gets even better: Smith claims that his grandma taught him the "rules of the house" – by which he means how to do basic math and fold a fitted sheet. He also credits her with instilling in him a sense of respect for others, mainly because she would frequently yell at the TV during family movie nights.

When asked about his beauty routine, Smith deadpanned, "I'm a very soap, cold-water-on-the-face guy" – a regimen that has clearly paid off, given his chiseled cheekbones and perfectly coiffed hair. And by "coiffed," we mean braided into an intricate pattern that looks suspiciously like it was designed by a team of highly trained monkeys.

Smith's advice to young men looking to break into high fashion? "Keep your body right, got to keep your skin right." By which he means, of course, that they should all just look exactly like him – tanned, toned, and sporting an impeccable head of hair. Anything less would be simply uncivilized.

In related news, Smith's grandma has announced plans to write a bestselling memoir about her experiences raising a child who turned out to be basically the male version of Taylor Swift.
