In a bold move to make audiences question the very fabric of their existence, DC Studios has unleashed the Supergirl teaser trailer, a soul-crushing exploration of Kara Zor-El's existential dread. The film, set to premiere in 2026, promises to delve into the darkest corners of Kara's mind as she navigates the vast expanse of space, questioning the meaninglessness of her existence.

The trailer showcases Alcock's Kara grappling with the weight of her Kryptonian heritage, wrestling with loss and regret, and contemplating the bleakness of an uncaring universe. It's like if you watched a 12-hour loop of a kitten being slowly devoured by a black hole, but instead of kittens, it's Supergirl.

But wait, there's more! The trailer also introduces Jason Momoa as Lobo, a grizzled space bounty hunter who smokes cigars and has a bad attitude. Because what's more exciting than watching a 6'5" demigod with a beard that could give a werewolf a run for its money ride a spaceship while muttering existential monologues?

The plot follows Kara as she embarks on an interstellar journey, confronting the trauma of Krypton's destruction and the crushing despair that comes with knowing you'll never find true fulfillment in this godless universe. Joining her on this soul-crushing adventure are Matthias Schoenaerts as the villainous Krem of the Yellow Hills, who's probably just a metaphor for the existential dread that we all feel deep down.

The film is directed by Craig Gillespie and written by Ana Nogueira, because who better to tell the story of a space princess with angst than someone who's clearly never had to deal with the crushing ennui of modern life? DC Studios heads James Gunn and Peter Safran are producing, because they're probably just trying to distract us from the fact that their other movies are actually just rehashed versions of The Matrix.

Supergirl will debut in theaters on June 26, 2026, but honestly, who's going to show up? It's not like anyone wants to be reminded of the bleakness and pointlessness of existence.
