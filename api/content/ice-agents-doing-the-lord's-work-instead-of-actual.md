As President Trump's immigration crackdown continues to traumatize children and parents alike, faith groups have stepped up their efforts to provide support to immigrants. Because who needs actual humanitarian aid when you can just give a priest a prayer card with Saint Toribio Romo on it?

In the California city of Coachella, Catholic parishioners are busy delivering food boxes to immigrants too terrified to leave their homes. Meanwhile, in Nogales, Mexico, Catholic nuns and volunteers at the Kino Border Initiative are serving up two meals daily for deported immigrants and asylum seekers. Because what's a little deportation when you can have a free meal?

But wait, it gets even better! In El Paso, Texas, an interfaith group of about three dozen people regularly gather outside a federal building to pray for immigrant families. They also monitor immigration court hearings, because nothing says "justice" like watching poor people get deported.

And if that's not enough, some priests are now celebrating mass online for immigrants too scared to leave their homes. Because what's a little PTSD when you can have a virtual holy ritual?

Of course, there are those who oppose this whole "helping immigrants" thing. Take Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, who recently defended ICE agents' use of pepper balls against protesters. When asked about the incident on CNN's State of the Union, he said, "We'll look into all this. But I think the Ice agents are doing the Lord's work."

Because nothing says "Lord's work" like violently suppressing peaceful protests.

As one Catholic priest noted, "In some cases, it's fear. In many cases, it's terror." Yeah, and in most cases, it's just plain ol' human decency. But hey, who needs that when you have a prayer card with Saint Toribio Romo on it?

So if you're an immigrant facing deportation, take heart! Just remember to grab your prayer card, hold onto your rosary, and prepare for the inevitable arrival of ICE agents doing their Lord's work.
