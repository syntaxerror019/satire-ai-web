Are you tired of being bombarded with notifications about the latest black hole discoveries, galaxy mergers, and astronaut selfies? Well, congratulations are in order: you're a functioning member of society and not completely immune to the siren song of space news.

But seriously, if you're like us, you signed up for those Space.com notifications and now your phone is blowing up with alerts about "Astronaut's Spacewalk Delayed Due To Socks" or "New Study Reveals The Existence Of Alien Life Forms (Spoiler Alert: It's Just Us)". We get it, we love space too, but can't you just leave us alone?

Luckily for you, the geniuses at Google Chrome and Safari have made it ridiculously easy to turn off these pesky notifications. And by "ridiculously easy", we mean that you'll need to take a few minutes away from your cat videos and scroll through about five menus.

To disable those annoying Space.com notifications in Google Chrome, follow these super-complicated steps:

1. Open Chrome on whatever device you're getting notifications on (we recommend using a hazmat suit).
2. Click the three vertical dots in the top right corner of your screen (no, it's not a portal to another dimension, just the menu).
3. Select "Settings" because who doesn't love settings?
4. Scroll all the way down to the bottom and click on "Advanced" because you're about to enter a realm where the ordinary rules of reality no longer apply.
5. Click on "Privacy and security" because you have some important secrets to hide from Space.com.
6. Select "Site Settings" (or "Content Settings", we won't judge you for not knowing) because this is where the magic happens.

And that's it! You're basically a tech wizard now, capable of turning off those annoying notifications with just a few clicks. Congratulations!

But wait, what if you want to turn them back on? Well, in that case, congratulations are in order again: you've managed to achieve the impossible and simultaneously ruin your life by opting out of Space.com's notification system.

To re-enable those notifications, simply head back to the website, click on the padlock logo, and select "Allow". And if you're feeling particularly masochistic, you can also try turning off your phone and living in a cave for a few weeks. We hear it's a real space-time continuum experience.
