In a bizarre move to repurpose the great outdoors, nail artists have begun slapping deer prints on people's nails, because why not? It turns out that combining animal print with polka dots and brown colors is the ultimate in trend-setting genius. Who needs personal style when you can just have your hands look like a Bambi had a nervous breakdown?

Julie Kandalec, a nail artist in New York City (presumably where all the best nail artists go to get their licenses revoked), claims that people love deer print nails because they're "rustic and fanciful." Which is code for "we've given up on life and are just slapping animal prints on everything now."

According to data from Fresha, a booking platform for beauty and wellness services (where the phrase "wellness" is clearly used as a euphemism for "I'm feeling pretty okay today"), polka dot nails are the most searched manicure. But that's not enough - no, we need to take it up a notch by replacing those precise dots with random splotches that look like they were painted on by a toddler having a temper tantrum.

Don't worry, getting deer print nails is easy! All you need is a gradient brush (think of it as a nail art equivalent of a paint-splattered apron), some gel polish, and a lot of patience. Because when you're trying to recreate the intricate patterns on a deer's fur with just your bare hands and a tiny brush, it's not like you're going to be stuck in a never-ending loop of "oh wait, I need more brown" or anything.

Ridley, another nail artist who clearly has too much time on her hands, recommends using gel polish because it locks each layer in place, preventing the inevitable muddle that occurs when you try to blend too many different shades of brown together. Because nothing says "luxurious manicure" like a bunch of sloppy splotches that resemble a failed art project.

But hey, at least it's a unique look! And who needs personal style when you can just have your hands look like they were attacked by a pack of wild deer?
