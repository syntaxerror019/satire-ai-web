In a shocking display of leadership, President Trump has called on the Senate to abolish the filibuster, citing its "stupid" rules and "terrible" traditions. According to sources close to the White House, Trump is fed up with the Senate's pesky checks on his power and wants to be able to ram through his agenda without any pesky opposition.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune has thus far refused to cave to Trump's demands, citing concerns that abolishing the filibuster would give Democrats an unfair advantage in future Senate elections. But Trump is undeterred, and has taken to Twitter to rant about the "phony" Senate rules and the "losers" who support them.

Meanwhile, some pundits are suggesting that Democrats should actually help Trump kill the filibuster, citing it as a necessary step towards making the Senate more "democratic." Because, you know, what's more democratic than abolishing a rule designed to prevent a single party from ramming through its agenda without any input or dissent?

"It's time for the Democrats to put aside their partisan differences and join Trump in his quest to abolish the filibuster," said Jonathan Chait, a pundit who clearly has too much free time on his hands. "After all, what's a little thing like checks on executive power when you can have more efficient government?"

Of course, this plan is not without its potential drawbacks. For one, it would likely give Republicans the ability to pass their beloved tax cuts and deregulation bills with ease, which could have disastrous consequences for the environment, workers' rights, and the economy as a whole.

But hey, who needs those things when you can have more "efficient" government? Not to mention the fact that Trump is a master deal-maker and will totally use his newfound power wisely.
