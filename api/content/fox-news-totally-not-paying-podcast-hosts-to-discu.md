In a shocking turn of events, it's been revealed that Fox News has not only started paying hosts to pretend to be interested in true crime cases on live TV but also created an entire podcast dedicated to the genre. Because what's more appealing to the masses than watching middle-aged men yell about Jennifer Dulos and Tammy Jo Brown? 

The podcast, titled "Crime Junkie", boasts a cast of two women who claim to have no relation to Fox News whatsoever (cough) but are instead just passionate true crime enthusiasts who happen to be friends with Ashley Flowers, the podcast's host. Flowers is described as a true crime aficionado who has been scouring the internet for years looking for answers to questions like "who killed JonBenet Ramsey?" and "what happened to the Duffys in New Hampshire?"

Each week, Flowers dives headfirst into a new case, meticulously researching every detail, even if it's just some random person on Reddit saying they think they know what really happened. And by "meticulously", we mean she has an assistant who does all the work while she sits around sipping coffee and making witty remarks.

But don't worry, folks! This isn't just a shallow attempt to cash in on the true crime craze – no, this is actually a deep exploration of the human condition. Said Flowers, "I'm not just interested in true crime cases; I'm fascinated by how our society reacts to them." Yeah, because nothing says "fascination" like being glued to your phone scrolling through Reddit for hours on end.

And if you're still not convinced that this is some kind of clever social commentary, fear not! The podcast is presented by Audiochuck Media Company – a totally-not-some-fox-news-executive's-wife-owned-and-operated company that has nothing to do with Fox News at all.
