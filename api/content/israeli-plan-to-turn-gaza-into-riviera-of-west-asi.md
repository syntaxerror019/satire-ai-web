In a shocking display of utter seriousness, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan on the sidelines of an Organization of Islamic Cooperation meeting in Jeddah to discuss ways to counter Israel's plans to forcibly displace Palestinians from Gaza. Because what could possibly go wrong with more meetings and hand-wringing about the situation?

The two diplomats expressed "deep concern" over Israel's attempts to erase Palestine through mass displacement, because clearly, a few more strongly-worded statements will definitely deter the Israeli government from carrying out its genocidal plans. They also reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia, because who needs actual progress on human rights when you can just have more photo ops?

Meanwhile, Iranian officials met with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan to discuss the broader challenges facing the Muslim world, including Israel's ongoing aggression in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank. Because it's not like Turkey has its own authoritarian regime or anything.

In a bold move, Araghchi warned that instability in Syria would only serve Israeli interests and provide a breeding ground for terrorist organizations, completely ignoring the fact that his own government is secretly funding those same terrorist groups to further their own agenda.

The Iranian foreign minister also met with officials from Tunisia, Egypt, and Oman to discuss regional developments and the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Because what's a few more meetings without any actual action or change?

In a final show of solidarity, all parties agreed that something should be done about Israel's apartheid policies and the forced displacement of Palestinians, but ultimately decided not to do anything about it because, you know, politics.

As one diplomat noted, "We must remain focused on the Palestinian cause and resist attempts to erase Palestine through mass displacement." Because what could possibly go wrong with that approach?
