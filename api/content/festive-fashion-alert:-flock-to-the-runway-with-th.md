It's that time of year again when we're forced to don our stretchy pants and pretend to be festive. But this year, things are getting weird - really weird. We've been tracking a trend that's making us question the very fabric of reality: the flocado.

So what is flocado? According to fashion experts (aka people who wear sparkly socks), it's like velvet but not actually velvet because who needs real velvet when you can have fake fiber optics glued onto your shirt. It's called "flocking" in English, which sounds suspiciously like a term used by cult leaders to describe their followers.

But hey, if you're into that sort of thing, you can flock out (get it?) with Mango, Cortefiel, Desigual, and Stradivarius. They've all got outfits featuring flocado so heavily applied, it's starting to look like they raided a craft store for all the glittery crap they could find.

And if that wasn't enough, Parfois is taking things to the next level with matching two-piece sets that will make you feel like you're wearing a tablecloth from IKEA. Because who needs individuality when you can blend in with the crowd and look like you just raided a 90s time capsule?

So go ahead, flock to the runway (okay, we'll stop) and show off your festive fashion disasters. Just don't say we didn't warn you...
