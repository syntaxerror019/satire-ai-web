In an absolute travesty of epic proportions, a legitimate developer is now warning users that some shady characters have stolen their thunder by creating a fake download site for the extremely useful Windows 11 upgrade bypass tool called Flyoobe. Because who needs official sources when you can just copy and paste the name into Google and hope for the best?

According to a "SECURITY ALERT" notice on the official GitHub page, an unofficial mirror of the tool is being hosted at flyoobe.net (seriously don't go there). The developer is begging users to only download from the official GitHub releases because, you know, they have no control over what's happening on that sketchy website. Who needs accountability and quality control when it comes to system-level access software?

Flyoobe itself is just a wonderful tool that lets you bypass those pesky compatibility checks (TPM module checks, etc.) and upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 with ease. It also comes with all sorts of useful features like removing AI-based components and trimming unnecessary features to create a lighter installation. What could possibly go wrong?

But wait, it gets better! Malicious versions of Flyoobe can include hidden keyloggers, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, or scripts that compromise sensitive data during the Windows installation process. So basically, just don't download anything from anyone ever.

And in case you were wondering, the reputable-sounding imposter website URL (flyoobe.net) is a real thing and not some kind of sick joke. We're sure it's just an honest mistake on the part of the nefarious developers who are clearly trying to ruin everything for everyone.

So let this be a lesson to us all: never, ever trust any download site that doesn't have "official" in the URL. And if you see someone offering you free pizza in exchange for downloading their version of Flyoobe, run away screaming.
