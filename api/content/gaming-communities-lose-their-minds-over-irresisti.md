Bertie, a notorious gaming enthusiast, has gone off the deep end over Sektori, a new game that he claims is like Geometry Wars, but also uniquely itself. We're not sure what's more disturbing - Bertie's obvious lack of self-awareness or his alarming tendency to use words like "nuance" and "strategy" in a gaming context.

Meanwhile, Victoria has discovered an escape room advent calendar featuring penguins, and she's absolutely freaking out about it. Because what's more terrifying than being trapped in a cardboard box with a bunch of partying penguins? We're sending help (and a few spare pens).

Marie is so excited for the upcoming Animal Crossing: New Horizons update that she's already started contemplating her life choices. "I was sure I had an idea" of what to do with her island, but now she's paralyzed by indecision. Sounds like someone needs to take a break from crafting Snowboys and get some therapy.

In other news, Tom is still playing Thank Goodness You're Here! on PS5, because who doesn't love a good dose of English life? It's like a warm hug for his eyeballs. We're not sure what's more disturbing - the game itself or the fact that someone actually wrote "I'm deliberately taking my time" as a gaming review.

Kelsey has discovered Species Unknown, a co-op horror game where you get to chase alien specimens around abandoned spaceships. Sounds like a real blast (pun intended). We're just waiting for her to send us a distress signal when she inevitably gets possessed by an otherworldly entity.

Connor is addicted to Umamusame: Pretty Derby on PC, and we're starting to think he's secretly a professional gamer or a penguin. "I'll play it until New Years and then I'll sort my life out" - yeah, right, buddy. We'll believe it when we see it.

Ed has discovered Dispatch, a game where you get to dispatch superheroes in a hilarious (and slightly disturbing) minigame. Sounds like the perfect game for couples who love to argue over trivial things... or compete with each other in a ridiculous, over-the-top manner.

Finally, Taps is regretfully informing us that Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension DLC is absolutely terrible. But hey, at least it's funny?
