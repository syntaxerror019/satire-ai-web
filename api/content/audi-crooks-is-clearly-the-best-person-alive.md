In a shocking turn of events, Audi Crooks has been dominating the court with her incredible skills, making everyone forget that she's also a functioning member of society off the court. This 21-year-old college student is averaging a whopping 27.8 points per game while only playing for 25.7 minutes, which we can only assume means she spends the rest of her time in the shower, bathing in champagne and adoration.

Her impressive stats have earned her a spot on the "Player of the Year" shortlist, beating out other notable candidates like Sarah Strong, Azzi Fudd, and Lauren Betts. Who needs actual experience or awards when you can just put up ridiculous numbers in a few games?

Crooks' rise to fame is being hailed as a game-changer for women's basketball, because who doesn't love a good Cinderella story? Her 40-point games against Indiana and Valparaiso were almost like her own personal highlight reel, complete with dramatic music and pyrotechnics.

But don't just take our word for it – experts are raving about Crooks' "well-rounded" game. By well-rounded, we mean she can occasionally shoot from outside the paint without embarrassing herself. It's a revolutionary skill that will surely serve her well in the WNBA... or at least give her a job as a spokesperson for athletic wear companies.

With another year of dominating under her belt (or not), Crooks is sure to be a top pick in the draft, beating out actual talented athletes with actual skills. It's only a matter of time before she becomes a household name, and we can't wait to see what other absurd accolades come her way.
