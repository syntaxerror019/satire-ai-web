Conservative activist Erika Kirk is somehow still alive despite being accused of child trafficking, or at least that's what some social media users thought. But it turns out all the drama was just a big misunderstanding.

Apparently, someone shared an old Haaretz article from 2001 about Romanian kids allegedly having their organs sold on the black market for transplants, and because Kirk was mentioned in one of the comments as being 13 years old at the time, everyone thought she was involved. Meanwhile, another post used a 2022 BBC video about sex trafficking in Romania, but since it didn't mention Kirk, it just got lost in translation.

It gets even better - some people also shared a flier for Kirk's Romanian Angels project from back in 2012, which allowed people to sponsor Romanian kids and send them gifts. Yes, you read that right - gifts. Not adopted children or anything sketchy like that. Just a nice care package with some stuff the kids might like.

When we asked around, nobody seemed to know where this whole "banned from Romania" thing came from. The U.S. Marine Corps didn't get back to us about their supposed partnership with Kirk's charity, and even the Romanian government couldn't be bothered to respond to our emails. Guess they were just too busy not accusing her of trafficking to care.

In the end, it all turned out to be a big ol' misinformation mess, and we're left wondering who started this whole charade in the first place. Was it a case of mistaken identity? A misunderstanding about what "sponsoring" means? Or were people just trying to get their clicks up on social media by sharing some juicy-sounding but entirely fabricated claims?

Whatever the reason, one thing's for sure: Erika Kirk is still standing, and her charity is still sending gifts to Romanian kids. Meanwhile, we're over here shaking our heads at the absurdity of it all.
