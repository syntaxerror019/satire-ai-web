In a bold move to protect the intellectual property of its deeply original and not-at-all-plagiarized content, The Heritage Foundation has issued a stern warning to anyone who dares to copy-paste their entire website. Because let's be real, who needs actual creativity when you can just lift it from someone else?

Under the terms of their "relaxed" copyright policy, users are free to share unedited and complete copies of web pages as long as they include the original headline (which is probably a carefully crafted clickbait title) and entire text. But don't even think about Photoshopping out that one awkward font choice – that's just theft.

But fear not, dear artists and journalists! You may reproduce our work for "educational, journalistic, commentary, or artistic purposes" as long as you follow the usual rules of copyright law (i.e., get permission from the original authors and pay them a handsome sum). And by "artistic purposes," we mean using our content to illustrate your own creative masterpiece – not actually making fun of our outdated policy.

And just in case you were thinking of getting a little too creative, be warned: any unauthorized use of photographs or illustrations credited to The Heritage Foundation will result in swift and merciless punishment. Like, literally the Heritage Foundation's lawyers are going to come after you with pitchforks.

If you have any questions about this super-strict copyright policy, just shoot an email to [email protected]. We're sure they'll be thrilled to hear from you – as long as you're not trying to steal their lunch money.
