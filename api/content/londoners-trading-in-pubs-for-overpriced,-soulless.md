In a shocking turn of events, Londoners are ditching their traditional pubs for overpriced, soulless American-style dive bars that serve as little more than an excuse to Instagram a mediocre beer and claim to be "experiencing the culture." Because what's more British than paying $15 for a Pabst Blue Ribbon and pretending to be a hipster?

The trend is led by bars like Easy 8, which boasts a "cramped, bustling" atmosphere that can only be described as "trying too hard." Owner Julian Denis claims his bar is the real deal, citing its proximity to local drug dealers as proof of authenticity. Because nothing says "dive bar" like being within arm's reach of a shady dealer.

But are these bars actually dive bars? Or are they just expensively dressed-up versions of your average British pub? It's a question that's left many Brits scratching their heads and wondering if they've been duped into paying too much for a beer. And by "many Brits," I mean the one dude in Shoreditch who thinks he's edgy.

The answer, of course, is not to be found in the bars themselves, but in the existential crisis that comes with paying $15 for a Pabst Blue Ribbon and still being expected to have some semblance of human interaction. It's like the Brits are saying, "You know what? Forget the pubs. Let's just pay more money for beer and pretend we're experiencing something authentic." And by "authentic," I mean not being able to afford a decent pint in your local pub.

In conclusion, Londoners are trading in their traditional pubs for overpriced, soulless American-style dive bars that serve as little more than an excuse to take Instagram-worthy photos of themselves trying to be hipsters. Because what's more British than paying too much money for beer and pretending to be someone you're not?
