In a bold move to show the world it's not completely committed to destroying the planet, AI training giant xAI announced plans to build a solar power plant near its massive data center in Memphis. Because who needs renewable energy when you've got coal?

The 30-megawatt solar farm will be just enough to power about 10% of Colossus, xAI's gargantuan data center that requires as much energy as a small city. The rest will still come from the usual suspects: 400+ MW of turbines churning out pollutants and destroying lungs for miles around.

But hey, at least they're trying! And by "trying," we mean they're doing the bare minimum required to avoid being sued into oblivion. xAI's plan is to continue burning fossil fuels on a massive scale while pretending to care about the environment.

The company's commitment to sustainability is reflected in its new slogan: "We'll use some solar power, but mostly coal, because that's what our investors want!" (Side effects may include asthma, lung cancer, and a strong urge to move to a different planet.)

xAI's partnership with Seven States Power Corporation on another project, which combines 100 MW of solar panels with 100 MW of batteries, is also a bold step towards reducing carbon emissions. Said one xAI spokesperson, "We're not just pretending to care about the environment; we're actually going to do something, but only if it's profitable!"

In related news, the Southern Environmental Law Center has filed a lawsuit against xAI for violating air quality regulations and causing widespread suffering among local residents. But don't worry, xAI will continue to pollute until it can be shown that alternative energy sources are viable – or at least until someone else takes the fall.
