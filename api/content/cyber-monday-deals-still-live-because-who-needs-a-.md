You're probably still reeling from the exhaustion of waking up at 4am to snag that one discounted toaster on Black Friday. Don't worry, it's okay to extend your holiday shopping hangover into Cyber Monday because, honestly, who needs human interaction when there are discounts to be had?

According to sources (i.e., a quick Google search), Cyber Monday is still live because the retailers are just really passionate about milking this whole holiday season thing. It's like they're trying to make us all love the idea of waking up at 3am to click "buy now" on a discounted TV.

But wait, it gets even better! These deals aren't going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, most retailers are still peddling their wares from November 2nd to December 1st because who needs to stick to a schedule when you're trying to make money off our collective holiday shopping anxiety?

Amazon's got deals that'll last until December 1st (yawn), while Best Buy is still peddling its discounted TVs and laptops like they're going out of style. And Walmart, bless their hearts, is offering online-only deals because who needs to actually go to a store when you can just click "add to cart" in your PJs?

So, if you've already blown through your holiday budget on overpriced electronics and tacky decorations, don't worry – there's still plenty of time to spend more money. In fact, we recommend setting up a direct deposit from your paycheck straight into Amazon Prime because who needs basic human dignity when you can have free shipping?

In related news, Keepa and CamelCamelCamel are still available for download, just in case you need some help tracking those sneaky price hikes. Happy shopping, everyone!
