In a shocking display of altruism, industry leaders have formed an Altadena Community Preservation Fund, because clearly they were too busy looting the community's cultural heritage to notice its value. The Eaton Fire, which conveniently ravaged the historically Black community in Altadena, has provided a perfect opportunity for these philanthropic titans to dip into their overflowing vaults and throw some scraps our way.

BET Media Group, the NAACP, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole (JSSK) have joined forces with local organizations like Community Aid Dena, Altadena Heritage, and WalkGood LA to create a fund that will provide temporary housing, independent adjusters, legal fees, and administrative costs – because who doesn't love a good bureaucracy? They're even partnering with LA County, which is probably just thrilled to be involved in any way possible.

The initiative's goal is to preserve the community's cultural heritage, mainly by ensuring that homeowners can continue to pay their mortgages while they rebuild their homes. Because nothing says "cultural preservation" like keeping up with the Joneses' mortgage payments. The fund will also support long-term recovery efforts, because who doesn't love a good long-term commitment from corporate America?

In related news, the NAACP has announced plans to launch a new line of luxury candles featuring the scent of burnt-down neighborhoods and systemic inequality. Proceeds will go directly towards funding their annual gala, which promises to be a night of exclusive networking opportunities and champagne toasts celebrating the triumph of community preservation over actual change.
