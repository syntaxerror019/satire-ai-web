In a shocking turn of events, Google has managed to create phones that are almost as soulless as iPhones. The Pixel 10 series is the culmination of years of research and development into making phones that look and feel like every other phone on the market. Gone are the days of individuality and expression with your phone's design - now you can blend in seamlessly with the Apple-wearing masses.

The new design, which has been described as "a very slightly better version" of last year's model, features a bold new look that is almost identical to the iPhone's. The aluminum frame is still there, but now it's paired with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (patent pending: "we just got bored and used something else"). The base model has a matte finish on the metal frame, because who needs texture and grip when you're holding a $1,000 phone?

But wait, there's more! The Pro phones have the opposite design - a glossy rear panel with a matte finish on the metal frame. Because, why not? It's not like this is going to make the phone more prone to slipping out of your hand and shattering into a thousand pieces. And who needs security when you can have style?

The buttons on the Pixel 10 are also an improvement over last year's model, with tighter tolerances and clickier feedback. Because what's more important than having a phone that sounds like a keyboard when you press the keys? It's not like this is going to make the phone easier to use or anything.

In other news, Google has announced that they will be adding even more AI features to the Pixel 10 series. Because who needs human intuition and common sense when you have machine learning algorithms? These new features will probably include things like automatic coffee ordering and cat video generation, because why not?

And finally, in a bold move, Google has decided to kill off the SIM card slot. Not just because Apple did it first (because that's always a good reason), but because who needs physical connections when you have wireless networks? It's not like your phone will suddenly become useless without a data connection or anything.

In conclusion, the Pixel 10 series is the perfect phone for anyone who wants to blend in with the crowd and surrender their individuality to the cold, soulless void of corporate conformity.
