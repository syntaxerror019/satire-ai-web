Grief Experts Paid by CNN to Just Talk About Sad Stuff for Hours

Are you tired of feeling sad? Do you wish there was someone to validate your emotions and make you feel even more down about life? Well, you're in luck! CNN's "All There Is with Anderson Cooper" podcast is here to exploit the vulnerability of its listeners by getting celebrities to just talk about their grief for hours on end.

In a recent episode, Anderson Cooper sat down with author Andrew Sullivan, who shared his "complicated grief" feelings after his mom died and his friends started dying from AIDS. Because what's more relatable than a privileged white guy complaining about the struggles of being gay in America? 

But wait, it gets even better! On another episode, actor Will Reeve (son of Superman Christopher Reeve) joined Anderson to discuss his "long journey into grief" after losing both parents at a young age. Because nothing says "inspiring true story" like a kid whose dad was a famous superhero who died tragically.

And don't even get me started on the episode with David and Amy Sedaris, where they talked about their various family members who have passed away, including their mom's pet rabbit. Yes, you read that right - their mom's pet rabbit. Because nothing says "heartfelt conversation" like a couple talking about the loss of their mother's beloved furry companion.

But hey, if you're feeling down and just need someone to validate your emotions, CNN has got you covered! Just visit allthereisonline.cnn.com (which is apparently where all the sad people go) and spend hours listening to Anderson Cooper interviewing celebrities who are just as miserable as you are. It's like a never-ending support group, but without any actual support or help.
