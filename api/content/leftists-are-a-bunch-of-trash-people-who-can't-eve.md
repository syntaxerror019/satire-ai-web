I mean, who needs actual facts when you've got feelings, am I right? Democrats have been whining about everything from the invention of the wheel to the price of avocados on toast. But let's be real, they're not really protesting anything - they're just there for the free t-shirts and Instagram likes.

I've been to a few protests in my time, but only because I needed something to do with my friends who were trying to get some action, or because we heard there would be free food. And let's be real, most of those people have no idea what they're protesting about - they just show up and chant "What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!" without even knowing what justice is.

And don't even get me started on how they're always complaining about police brutality, but never seem to care when a black person kills a cop. In fact, they'll usually just blame the cop for being racist or something. It's like, come on guys - if you want to be taken seriously, at least try to be consistent in your outrage.

But hey, who needs consistency when you've got a good excuse to smash some windows and loot? And don't worry about the facts - Democrats are all about feelings and perceptions, not actual truth. They'll just make up something that sounds good and hope nobody fact-checks them.

And let's be real, folks - if you're calling for the killing of ICE agents or civil war, you're basically saying "Hey, I'm a crazy person who can't handle criticism!" But hey, who needs to be taken seriously when you've got a good chant?
