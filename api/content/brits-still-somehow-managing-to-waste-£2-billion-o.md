As the annual ritual of overpaying for internet continues, experts are urging Brits to finally get their acts together and switch broadband providers. Because who needs a decent WiFi signal when you can have a bunch of unnecessary fees tacked on to your bill?

According to analysis from Broadband Genie, 8.8 million customers are currently stuck in contracts that are racking up an estimated £2 billion in collective overspend each year. That's like buying 44 million pounds' worth of mediocre takeout every year.

Broadband expert Alex Tofts is baffled by the lack of initiative from consumers. "It's just so easy to switch providers," he said, exasperated. "But no, instead we're all too busy arguing over who ate the last slice of pizza."

To help Brits avoid this collective financial catastrophe, Broadband Genie has shared its top tips for navigating Black Friday deals:

1. Only Pay For What You Need: Unless you're a professional gamer or work from home (in which case, good luck with that), a standard 50Mb fibre deal is all you need. Anything more and you're just throwing money at a speeding bullet of data.

2. Check Social Tariff Eligibility: If you're on benefits, congratulations! You might be eligible for one of those fancy social tariffs that'll save you a few quid each month. It's like getting a free hug from your internet provider.

3. Start Comparing Early: Providers will start tossing out their Black Friday exclusives around two weeks before the actual holiday. So go ahead, take a break from binge-watching Netflix and actually do some research for once.

4. Factor In Gifts And Vouchers: Some broadband providers offer gift cards or bill credits as part of their deals. Just remember to factor in the value of those rewards when calculating your effective monthly cost. Because nothing says "holiday cheer" like saving a few quid on your internet bill.

5. Time Your Switch: Don't be afraid to lock in a deal and set an activation date for when you need it. Unless, of course, you're moving house or have a new puppy that requires constant video calls with the grandparents. In which case, good luck with that.
