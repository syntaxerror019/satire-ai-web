Yes, you've done all that hard work, you've signed the whole thing off, you've unveiled your palatial creation to the world, and that's when you realize you've forgotten one tiny yet crucial detail: not making it look like an old Morgan that's crashed into a Bentley Mulsanne, and then somehow melted quite a lot. So close, yet so far.

We at our top-secret research facility have been studying these automotive abominations for years, and we're still trying to figure out what possessed the engineers to create such monstrosities. Was it a combination of too much coffee, not enough sleep, and a dash of existential dread? Or was it just a team-building exercise gone horribly wrong?

Take, for example, the 2003 Pontiac Aztek, which appears to have been designed by a committee of confused kindergarteners on a sugar high. Its angular lines, mismatched trim, and awkward proportions make it look like it was put together by a blindfolded toddler with a box of LEGOs.

And then there's the 2011 Chrysler PT Cruiser, which seems to have been styled after a cross between a boxy, ancient Greek temple and a sad, rejected Muppet. Its bulbous nose, awkward stance, and overall air of "I give up" make it the perfect vehicle for the socially anxious introvert.

But wait, there's more! Our team has identified 39 other cars that are just as visually off-putting, if not more so. There's the 2007 Mercury Mariner, which looks like a cross between a rejected prop from "Star Wars" and a used trash can; the 2015 Fiat 500L, which appears to have been styled after a rejected prototype for the " Transformers" movie; and the 2009 Cadillac CTS Sport Wagon, which seems to have been designed by a committee of sleepy accountants who just wanted to go home.

It's enough to make you wonder: what kind of sorcery do these car designers use? And more importantly, how can we get our hands on some of that magic?
